🎮 Hackathon Project – Modular Gaming & Social Platform

A modular web platform combining games, live chat, video chat, experience leveling, and virtual currency.
Users engage by chatting, commenting, playing games, earning high scores, and inviting friends — gaining XP and leveling up.
XP and a virtual currency system unlock cosmetics and profile privileges.

The platform is designed to be modular, ensuring all games are developed within a common framework that integrates seamlessly with site features from the start.

Built during a hackathon using Roo Code and Gemini 3.5 for rapid prototyping and development.

🛠️ Tech Stack Recommendations

To save time and maximize modularity:

Frontend:

React (with Next.js for routing & SSR)

Tailwind CSS for rapid UI design

Socket.IO client for real-time communication

Backend:

Node.js with Express or NestJS

Socket.IO for live chat/game session updates

PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM) for users, XP, currency, and leaderboards

Redis for session management & real-time leaderboards

Video Chat:

WebRTC (with PeerJS or Daily.co/Twilio SDKs for ease of integration)

Hosting / DevOps:

Vercel or Netlify for frontend during hackathon

Railway or Supabase for backend + database hosting

Docker (optional, for containerized local dev)

AI Assistance:

Roo Code (code orchestration & task breakdown)

Gemini 3.5 (logic scaffolding & code generation)

👥 Team Roles & Task Breakdown
Frontend/UI Team

Design overall UI/UX

Implement React + Tailwind frontend

Build modular components (chat UI, profile pages, game shells)

Backend Team

User authentication & management

Experience, leveling, and currency systems

Leaderboards & stats tracking

API for games to hook into XP/currency

Games Team

Build games within the framework (so they integrate with XP, chat, and leaderboards)

Ensure each game supports multiplayer session states

Comms/Video Team

Implement WebRTC for video chat

Build chat room logic (global, per-game, private)

Integrate chat with XP rewards

Integration/Framework Team

Define the APIs/hooks for games to communicate with the platform

Ensure consistency across modules

Maintain developer docs for team members building games

🚀 Development Workflow

Setup repo & CI/CD

Use GitHub with branch protection & PR reviews

Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend to Railway

Core Framework First

Authentication

XP & currency system

Chat system

Leaderboards

Parallel Work

Frontend/UI team builds reusable components

Games team starts with a simple game (e.g., trivia or tic-tac-toe)

Video team integrates WebRTC

Integration Phase

Games plug into the XP/currency/chat/leaderboard framework

End-to-end testing with real users

📌 Hackathon Priorities

Since time is limited:

✅ Get core loop working (user signs up → chats/plays game → earns XP → spends currency).

✅ Have at least 1 working game integrated with chat, XP, and leaderboards.

✅ Make the UI clean and intuitive (focus on core features, polish later).

✅ Document APIs/hooks so additional games can be added easily.

🏗️ Future Enhancements

Marketplace for cosmetics & profile themes

More multiplayer games

Friend system & invites

Mobile-first responsive design

Achievements & badges

Would you like me to also add a sample project structure layout (folders for frontend, backend, games, shared modules, etc.) so your team has a skeleton repo ready to go?
