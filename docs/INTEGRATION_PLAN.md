# Worker Logic Integration Plan

## 1. Overall Strategy

This document outlines the integration plan for the new worker logic proposed in `WORKERLOGIC.MD`. After a thorough analysis, a direct replacement of the current system was deemed too disruptive. Instead, we will adopt a **hybrid approach**, integrating the most valuable features of the proposed logic into our existing, flexible architecture.

This strategy will allow us to enhance our system's capabilities without sacrificing the benefits of our current design, such as multi-user support, advanced job management, and an extensible architecture.

## 2. Integration Phases

The integration will be executed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Enhance Core Capabilities

- **Subtask 1: Enhance `worker/ai_orchestrator.py`**
  - **Goal:** Integrate the advanced LLM interfaces from the proposal.
  - **Details:** This involves adding support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) and improving the prompt generation and management capabilities.

- **Subtask 2: Enhance `worker/patcher.py`**
  - **Goal:** Integrate the advanced GitHub PR creation features.
  - **Details:** This includes more robust error handling, better PR descriptions, and more sophisticated retry logic for API interactions.

### Phase 2: Unify Code Analysis

- **Subtask 3: Design a Unified Code Analysis Component**
  - **Goal:** Create a design for a new component that merges the strengths of `worker/parser.py` and the proposed `code_analyzer`.
  - **Details:** The new component should be more efficient, provide more detailed code analysis, and be easily extensible.

- **Subtask 4: Implement the Unified Analysis Component**
  - **Goal:** Build the new analysis component based on the design from Subtask 3.

### Phase 3: Final Integration and Documentation

- **Subtask 5: Update Backend**
  - **Goal:** Update the backend to utilize the new and improved worker modules.

- **Subtask 6: Update Documentation**
  - **Goal:** Update all project documentation to reflect the changes.
  - **Files to Update:** `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and any other relevant documents.

- **Subtask 7: Update Logs**
  - **Goal:** Update `docs/DEVLOG.md` and `docs/IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md`.

## 3. Conclusion

This phased approach will allow us to incrementally improve our system while minimizing risk. Each phase will deliver tangible benefits, and the final result will be a more powerful and robust platform.
