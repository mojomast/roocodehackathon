## [2025-08-29] - Initial Documentation Setup Complete

- Completed initial README.md with comprehensive project overview
- Added detailed explanation of FixMyDocs as a SaaS documentation agent
- Included hackathon context and project architecture information
- Set up project structure documentation
- Ready for further development and feature implementation
## Phase 1: Foundational Fixes & Environment Setup - COMPLETE

- Standardized the worker to use Celery.
- Aligned the backend database to use PostgreSQL.
- Created `.env.template` files and configured `docker-compose.yml` to use them.
- Implemented a placeholder for the GitHub authentication flow.
- Fixed the root navigation to redirect to the dashboard.

The foundational architecture is now stable and ready for core feature development.
## Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation - MVP - COMPLETE

- **Backend:** Implemented API endpoints for connecting repositories (`/api/repos/connect`), running analysis jobs (`/api/docs/run`), and checking job status (`/api/jobs/status/{job_id}` and `/api/jobs`).
- **Worker:** Developed a simulated Celery task that progresses through various stages (cloning, parsing, generating) and updates the job status in the database.
- **Frontend:** Connected the UI to the backend, allowing users to connect a repository, trigger an analysis job, and view the job's status in near real-time.

The core end-to-end functionality of the application is now implemented.
## Phase 3: UI/UX & Frontend Polish - COMPLETE

- **UI Components:** The dashboard, repositories, and jobs pages have been updated with improved layouts and now display dynamic data.
- **User Feedback:** Loading indicators and user-friendly error states have been implemented across the application.
- **Gamification:** The dashboard now displays placeholder gamification elements (Points, Level, Badges), setting the stage for future implementation.

The frontend has been polished, resulting in a more intuitive and responsive user experience.
## Phase 4: Production Readiness & Deployment - COMPLETE

- **Testing:** Set up `pytest` for the backend/worker and Jest/React Testing Library for the frontend. Placeholder tests have been created.
- **Security:** Implemented basic authentication middleware and input validation on the backend.
- **CI/CD:** Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automate linting and testing for all services on every push and pull request.

The application is now equipped with a foundational CI/CD pipeline and basic security, making it more robust and maintainable.

## [2025-08-29 19:58] Roo Code Assessment
- **Reviewed existing codebase structure**: Found a well-architected microservices setup (Next.js, FastAPI, Celery) with Docker.
- **Found placeholder implementations in**:
  - **Backend**: GitHub OAuth integration (`/api/auth/github`, `/auth/github/callback`).
  - **Worker**: Core task execution (`process_documentation_job` uses `time.sleep`).
  - **Frontend**: All API calls are commented out and replaced with `setTimeout` simulations.
- **Identified priority gaps**:
  - **Critical**: No actual GitHub integration for repo access or PR creation.
  - **Critical**: The worker lacks any real code analysis or documentation generation logic.
  - **Critical**: The frontend is completely disconnected from the backend.
  - **Documentation**: `DEVLOG.md` is inaccurate, `README.md` lacks detail, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` has broken links.
- **Next steps**:
  1.  **High Priority**: Implement Backend API integration in the frontend.
  2.  **High Priority**: Implement the GitHub OAuth flow in the backend.
  3.  **Medium Priority**: Implement the core AI logic in the worker.
