# Agent Handover Instructions

## Mission Objective
The primary objective is to resolve all 67 outstanding issues in the FixMyDocs codebase, as detailed in `docs/ISSUE_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md`. The full plan involves implementing all fixes across five priority milestones (P0-P4), updating all relevant documentation, and consolidating the work into a single final commit.

## Work Completed
Progress has been made on the **P0 - Critical Security Issues** milestone. The following fixes have been implemented:

### Backend Security
- **BE-003 & Webhook Security:**
  - **File:** `backend/main.py`
  - **Changes:**
    - Strengthened authentication token validation in the `verify_auth_token` function.
    - Implemented HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for the `/api/github/webhook` endpoint.

### Frontend Security
- **FE-002 (CSP):**
  - **File:** `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - **Changes:** Added a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
- **FE-003 (Open Redirect):**
  - **File:** `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`
  - **Changes:** Improved redirect URL validation and sanitization in the `validateRedirectURL` function.
- **FE-004 (Error Handling):**
  - **File:** `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Changes:** Wrapped the "Recent Screenshots" component with an `ErrorBoundary`.
  - **File:** `frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
  - **Changes:** Enhanced the fallback UI for the error boundary.

## Current Blocker & Immediate Next Steps
The current task is to set up the Jest testing environment for the frontend to validate the security fixes. This has been a multi-step process and is currently blocked.

- **Problem:** The test suite fails because Jest's Node.js environment lacks browser-native APIs (like `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `TransformStream`) required by dependencies such as `msw` (Mock Service Worker).
- **Last Action:** The `web-streams-polyfill` dependency was added to `frontend/package.json` to provide the missing `TransformStream` API.
- **Immediate Next Step:** The new dependency has not been installed yet. You must run `npm install` inside the `frontend` directory to resolve the `Cannot find module 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill'` error and proceed with debugging the test environment.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Remaining Tasks
Once the test environment is functional, the following high-level tasks remain:
PLEASE VERIFY THIS HAS NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED YET BEFORE DOING THEM.
1.  **Complete P0 Fixes:** Finish implementing the remaining critical security fixes as detailed in `docs/ISSUE_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md`.
2.  **Implement P1-P4:** Systematically work through the high (P1), medium (P2), low (P3), and very-low (P4) priority fixes.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Ensure `docs/ISSUE_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md` is updated to track the status of each fix.
4.  **Finalize and Commit:** Verify all changes, update the main `README.md`, and consolidate all work into a single, comprehensive commit.

Please continue from the **Immediate Next Step** outlined above.
